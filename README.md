# Dev-Certification-for-Machine-Learning-with-Tensorflow-DCML-Preparation

# Introduction
Welcome to Dev Certification for Machine Learning with Tensorflow (DCML) Preparation course from Dicoding. This course will provide three different packages that simulate what you will be facing when taking the actual DCML exam from the dev.id certification or dev.cert. 

### The following 3 packages are:

Simulation Package A: consists of 5 machine learning problems. 
Simulation Package B: consists of 5 machine learning problems. The datasets used in Simulation B are different from the dataset in Simulation A.
Simulation Package C: consists of 5 machine learning problems. The datasets used in Simulation C are different from the dataset in Simulations A and B.
In each simulation, the exam will test you on these set of skills (please refer to the Candidate Handbook for the details of each category):

### Tensorflow developer skills
You need to demonstrate that you understand how to develop software programs using TensorFlow and that you can find the information you need to work as an ML practitioner.
Building and training neural network models using TensorFlow

You need to understand the foundational principles of machine learning and deep learning using TensorFlow 2.x.

### Image Classification
You need to understand how to build image recognition and object detection models with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow 2.x.
Natural language processing (NLP)

You need to understand how to use neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow.

### Time Series, sequence, and predictions
You need to understand how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow.
