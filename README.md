# Dev-Certification-for-Machine-Learning-with-Tensorflow-DCML-Preparation

Introduction
Welcome to Dev Certification for Machine Learning with Tensorflow (DCML) Preparation course from Dicoding. This course will provide three different packages that simulate what you will be facing when taking the actual DCML exam from the dev.id certification or dev.cert. 

The following 3 packages are:

Simulation Package A: consists of 5 machine learning problems. 
Simulation Package B: consists of 5 machine learning problems. The datasets used in Simulation B are different from the dataset in Simulation A.
Simulation Package C: consists of 5 machine learning problems. The datasets used in Simulation C are different from the dataset in Simulations A and B.
In each simulation, the exam will test you on these set of skills (please refer to the Candidate Handbook for the details of each category):

Tensorflow developer skills
You need to demonstrate that you understand how to develop software programs using TensorFlow and that you can find the information you need to work as an ML practitioner.
Building and training neural network models using TensorFlow
You need to understand the foundational principles of machine learning and deep learning using TensorFlow 2.x.
Image Classification
You need to understand how to build image recognition and object detection models with deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks using TensorFlow 2.x.
Natural language processing (NLP)
You need to understand how to use neural networks to solve natural language processing problems using TensorFlow.
Time Series, sequence, and predictions
You need to understand how to solve time series and forecasting problems in TensorFlow.
Simulation Guideline:

Ensure that your computer meets the system requirement:
OS: Windows, Linux, or macOS
Processor: Intel Dual Core (Recommended: Core i3 ke atas)
RAM: 4GB (Recommended: 8GB)
Screen Resolution: 1366 x 768 (Recommended: Full HD 1920 x 1080)
Ensure you have Python 3.8 installed on your computer. You must install the Python environment from the official Python packages available at Python.org.
You will take the real Dev Certification for Machine Learning with Tensorflow (DCML) using PyCharm IDE or Visual Studio Code. So we strongly recommend you undertake this Preparation course in PyCharm IDE or Visual Studio Code to get you familiar with using the environment to train TensorFlow models. For the PyCharm installation guide, refer to this link: Install PyCharm.
To build machine learning models in this preparation course, you will need some library packages installed in your environment, such as:
numpy==1.24.3
pandas==2.0.3
Pillow==10.0.0
scipy==1.10.1
tensorflow==2.13.0
tensorflow-datasets==4.9.2
Please be aware that the size of the dataset (used in the image classification problems) and the saved model in the .h5 file extension are big. So you need to make sure when you work with the exam, you use the best internet provider in your area with adequate internet service. You may also prepare another internet service provider for backup if needed.
The real Dev Certification for Machine Learning with Tensorflow (DCML) is expected to take up to 5 hours. So, you have to finish each package of this Preparation course in 5 hours. Please make sure that you turn on your timer once you start doing your exam. It may help you manage your time during the Preparation course and feel the atmosphere of taking the actual certification.
You may use whatever learning resources you usually use during your machine learning development work. You may also use Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or a cloud-based virtual machine to help you train the machine learning model, but make sure that your final model is run on the PyCharm IDE.
You have to complete the exam on your own. Exams are not group projects, and you must not receive any help from anyone.
Do not share your exam code or talk about exam content with anyone. For example, don't write about the exam content in a blog post, share about the exam in a forum, or push exam code to a public repository such as GitHub. Both simulation course contents and the Dev Certification for Machine Learning with Tensorflow (DCML) contents are copyrighted and protected by law. All content is confidential. Failure to abide by the law will result in expulsion from any current and future Dicoding or Google programs.
